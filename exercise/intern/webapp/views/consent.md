# Bugmark Intern Exercise

This is an experimental exercise.

We're not trading real money here - just tokens.

We will likely publish the exercise results, but will do everthing we can to
keep your identity private.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

If you decide to participate in this exercise, you won't be given any training
or handholding.  To participate fully you'll have to self motivated and not 
shy about asking questions.

If you're willing to put up with all that, and have interest in our project,
and willing to put in some time and effort, then we will celebrate your 
involvement and hope you become a long-term participant and contributor.
