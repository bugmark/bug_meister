    b How do I earn money?
    p You earn money by working on issues, correctly solving these issues, and

  li
    b How do I check how much I have earned so far?
    p This is displayed in the top right corner along with your username.
  li
    b How are my answers/solutions evaluated?
    p As in any open source project, the repository maintainers are responsible for
      evaluating the submitted work and flagging the issue as fixed or unfixed. We
      will try to evaluate your submissions as soon as possible, but the process of
      evaluation may take time.
  li
    b What happens if my answer is wrong?

  li
    b How do I cash my earnings?

  li
    b What can I do for anonymity?
    p You can create an anonymous username and create an anonymous GitHub account. 

  li
    b Suppose I fund an offer with 10 tokens and no one accepts it, do I get 15 tokens after the maturation date?
    p No. An offer that no one accepts will be refunded, so you get 10 tokens back.

  li
    b When do I get 15 tokens after the maturation date?
    p Only if you fund a successful offer. That is, the offer is accepted and the issue is closed by the maturation date.

  li
    b Suppose that an offer is funded and accepted, and thus a contract is formed. How does the contract pay out at maturation?
    p If the issue is closed by the maturation date, the worker gets the contract payout of 20 tokens. Else the funder gets the contract payout.

  li
    b Is the contract payout reversed if an issue is reopened?
    p No. All payouts are final.

  li
    b Why are contracts not paid as soon as issues are closed? Instead we have to wait until the maturation date.
    p The design of our marketplace needs contracts to remain open and not be paid out until maturation. In a full implementation trading can continue to take place until the maturation date and issues might be reopened before the maturation date.

  li
    b Why do workers incur a cost of 10 tokens when they accept an offer?
    p If the issue is closed then the worker receives the 10 tokens back in the contract payout of 20 tokens. If the issue remains open then think of this as a form of compensation to the funder for not delivering the work.
